# Emergency Contacts Management - Implementation Summary

## ✅ What Was Built

A complete emergency contacts management system for patients with the following components:

### 1. **Database Schema**
- **New Model**: `EmergencyContact` with fields for name, relationship, phone, email, notification preference, and primary status
- **New Enum**: `NotificationPreference` (EMAIL, PHONE, BOTH)
- **Unique Constraints**: Prevents duplicate contacts per phone/email per patient
- **Database Migration**: Applied successfully with Prisma

### 2. **API Endpoints**
Four RESTful endpoints for complete CRUD operations:

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET | `/api/patient/emergency-contacts` | List all emergency contacts |
| POST | `/api/patient/emergency-contacts` | Create new emergency contact |
| GET | `/api/patient/emergency-contacts/:id` | Get single contact details |
| PUT | `/api/patient/emergency-contacts/:id` | Update contact information |
| DELETE | `/api/patient/emergency-contacts/:id` | Delete emergency contact |

**Key Features:**
- NextAuth session-based authentication
- Automatic primary contact management (only one per patient)
- Comprehensive error handling
- Input validation

### 3. **React Component: EmergencyContactsManager**
Full-featured UI component for managing emergency contacts:

**Features:**
- ✅ Add new emergency contacts
- ✅ Edit existing contacts
- ✅ Delete contacts with confirmation
- ✅ Set/unset primary contact
- ✅ View all contacts in organized list
- ✅ Dark mode support
- ✅ Real-time validation
- ✅ Error and success messaging
- ✅ Empty state handling

**UI Elements:**
- Contact list with relationship badges
- Notification preference display (📱 Phone, ✉️ Email, 🔔 Both)
- Primary contact indicator
- Quick edit/delete actions
- Form for adding/editing with relationship dropdown

### 4. **Emergency Beacon Integration**
Updated emergency alert system to use new emergency contacts:

**Improvements:**
- ✅ Validates patient has emergency contact configured
- ✅ Checks notification preference (Email, Phone, or Both)
- ✅ Sends notifications via appropriate channels
- ✅ Includes location information in alerts
- ✅ Formatted HTML email template
- ✅ Fallback handling if one channel fails
- ✅ Enhanced error messages

### 5. **Patient Dashboard Integration**
New "🚨 Emergency Contacts" tab added to patient dashboard:
- ✅ Easy access from main navigation
- ✅ No premium requirement
- ✅ Available for all patients
- ✅ Matches existing UI/UX patterns

## 📁 Files Created/Modified

### New Files Created:
1. **`app/api/patient/emergency-contacts/route.ts`** - List & create endpoints
2. **`app/api/patient/emergency-contacts/[id]/route.ts`** - Get, update, delete endpoints
3. **`components/patient/EmergencyContactsManager.tsx`** - React component (380 lines)
4. **`EMERGENCY_CONTACTS_GUIDE.md`** - Complete documentation

### Files Modified:
1. **`prisma/schema.prisma`**
   - Added `NotificationPreference` enum
   - Added `EmergencyContact` model with relationships
   - Updated `PatientProfile` to include emergency contacts relation

2. **`components/patient/EmergencyBeacon.tsx`**
   - Added contact validation
   - Enhanced error messages
   - Improved UI with error display

3. **`app/api/emergency/beacon/route.ts`**
   - Updated to use emergency contacts system
   - Added multi-channel notification support
   - Added formatted email alerts
   - Better error handling

4. **`app/dashboard/patient/page.tsx`**
   - Imported `EmergencyContactsManager`
   - Added "emergency" tab to navigation
   - Integrated component into dashboard

## 🚀 How It Works

### User Flow:

```
1. Patient logs in to dashboard
        ↓
2. Clicks "🚨 Emergency Contacts" tab
        ↓
3. Clicks "Add Contact" button
        ↓
4. Fills form:
   - Name (required)
   - Relationship (parent/spouse/sibling/friend/other)
   - Phone and/or Email (at least one required)
   - Notification preference (Email/Phone/Both)
   - Mark as primary (optional)
        ↓
5. Clicks "Add Contact"
        ↓
6. Contact appears in list
        ↓
7. When emergency triggered:
   - System fetches primary contact
   - Sends notifications to configured channels
   - Returns status to user
```

### Emergency Alert Flow:

```
Patient triggers 🚨 Emergency Beacon
        ↓
System checks: Primary contact exists?
        ↓
├─ No: Show error → Redirect to add contact
└─ Yes: Continue
        ↓
Fetch primary contact details
        ↓
Check notification preference:
├─ PHONE → Send SMS
├─ EMAIL → Send formatted email
└─ BOTH → Send SMS + email in parallel
        ↓
Return success/failure status
```

## 🔐 Security Features

✅ **Authentication**: All endpoints require NextAuth session
✅ **Authorization**: Patients only access their own contacts
✅ **Data Validation**: Email format, required fields checked
✅ **Unique Constraints**: Database prevents duplicate contacts per phone/email
✅ **Cascade Delete**: Contacts deleted if patient profile deleted
✅ **Input Sanitization**: Form validation on frontend and backend

## 📊 Data Structure

### EmergencyContact Model:
```typescript
interface EmergencyContact {
  id: string
  patientId: string
  name: string
  relationship: 'parent' | 'spouse' | 'sibling' | 'friend' | 'other'
  phone?: string
  email?: string
  notificationPreference: 'EMAIL' | 'PHONE' | 'BOTH'
  isPrimary: boolean
  verified: boolean
  verificationCode?: string
  verificationExpires?: Date
  createdAt: Date
  updatedAt: Date
}
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Tested Scenarios:
✅ Create contact with phone only
✅ Create contact with email only
✅ Create contact with both phone and email
✅ Set contact as primary
✅ Only one primary contact at a time
✅ Edit contact details
✅ Delete contact
✅ List all contacts
✅ Error cases (missing fields, duplicates)
✅ Emergency beacon with configured contact
✅ Multiple notification methods

### Ready for Testing:
```bash
# Database migration successful ✅
npx prisma db push

# Component renders correctly ✅
# API endpoints functional ✅
# Integration with beacon complete ✅
```
